# Argentum Age Game List (1.0.0)

This tool displays a list of servers to choose from to make it easier to find games to play - Official support sites: [Official Sourceforge Repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/argentum-age-game-list) - [Official Forum](https://argentumage.gameplayer.club/index.php/forum/argentum-age-utilities)

Copy **AAGames** to somewhere in your path - I suggest adding the directory you extracted this into your path so that you can just do "git pull" to download updates to this tool.

Run this:

- sudo cpan -i Wx
- sudo cpan -i wxPerl::Constructors
- sudo cpan -i Text::CSV

Then copy the file **rungame** to "**~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Argentum Age**"

You should now be able to run AAgames
